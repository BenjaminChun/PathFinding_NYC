## Problem statement
1. Given a graph of nodes and edges and a start and ending node. Find the shortest path from start to end.
2. Given the same graph but with new values for each edge (previously distance, now with distance and fuel cost), find the shortest path from start to end while complying to the fuel limit.

## Solution
